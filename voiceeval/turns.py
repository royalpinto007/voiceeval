"""The data model: a voice interaction as timed turns.

A text agent's transcript is a list of messages. A voice agent's transcript is a list of messages
*with clocks attached*, and the clocks are where the failures live.

This distinction is the entire reason this library exists. If you evaluate a voice agent by
reading its transcript, you are evaluating a text agent that happens to have been spoken. You will
score a call as perfect when the caller hung up during a four-second silence, or when the agent
confidently refunded fifteen dollars because it misheard fifty.

So every turn carries:
  - when it started and ended (latency, dead air, overlap)
  - what the STT *heard* vs what was *said*, when you have ground truth (mis-hearing)
  - what the agent *did*, not just what it said (actions are what cost money)
