"""The failures a text eval cannot see.

Every check here is invisible if you read the transcript as text. That is the point: read a call
transcript and it looks fine, because transcripts do not have clocks and do not record what the
caller actually said before the STT mangled it.

The five that matter, roughly in order of how much they cost:

1. mis-hearing on a consequential value. "Fifty" and "fifteen" are one phoneme apart, and the
   agent will act on either with equal confidence. This is the expensive one.
2. acting without confirming. A text agent that misreads can be corrected on the next line. A
   voice agent that mishears and immediately acts has already spent the money.
3. latency. Three seconds of silence on a phone call is a failed call, even if the answer that
   eventually arrives is perfect. Nobody notices this in a transcript.
4. talking over the caller. Barge-in that the agent ignores makes it feel broken.
5. dead air. Silence with nobody speaking is where callers hang up.
